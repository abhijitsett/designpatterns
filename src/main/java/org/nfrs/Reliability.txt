Reliability = system’s ability to perform its intended function consistently, even when faced with errors, failures, or high load.

Reliability Patterns:

| Pattern             | Description                 | Java / Tools Example                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Circuit Breaker** | Stop repeated failing calls | Resilience4j CircuitBreaker          |
| **Retry**           | Retry transient failures    | Spring Retry, CompletableFuture      |
| **Bulkhead**        | Isolate failures            | Thread pool per service              |
| **Failover**        | Switch to standby system    | Database replicas, multiple servers  |
| **Timeouts**        | Avoid indefinite blocking   | HttpClient timeout, DB query timeout |
| **Health Checks**   | Monitor components          | Spring Boot Actuator `/health`       |
