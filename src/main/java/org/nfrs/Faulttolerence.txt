Fault Tolerance = The ability of a system to continue operating correctly even when some of its components fail.

Fault Tolerance Patterns in Java :

| Pattern                  | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Retry**                | Retry transient errors with backoff              |
| **Circuit Breaker**      | Stop calling failing service                     |
| **Bulkhead**             | Isolate failures per service/thread pool         |
| **Failover**             | Switch to standby system                         |
| **Timeouts**             | Avoid hanging operations                         |
| **Graceful Degradation** | Reduce functionality instead of complete failure |
| **Event-driven queues**  | Buffer requests for retry / delayed processing   |
