The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that organizes objects
into tree structures, allowing clients to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.

Here These are introductions for the Components of the Composite Design:

Component – Defines a common interface that both leaf objects and composite objects implement.
Leaf – Represents simple, indivisible objects that perform operations directly.
Composite – Represents complex objects that can contain children (leaves or other composites) and delegate operations to them.
Client – Works with all objects through the Component interface, treating individual and composite objects uniformly.
